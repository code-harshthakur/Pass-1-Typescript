## Description 
 The TypeScript Assembler Project bridges traditional assembly language processing with modern TypeScript, offering a robust tool for compiling and parsing assembly instructions. It simplifies symbol and literal table management, streamlines memory assignments, and generates structured outputs. This project combines low-level programming's precision with TypeScript's clarity, making it ideal for educational purposes and enhancing programming tasks.

## üßê Features    
- **Assembles Assembly Language Input**: Processes an assembly language input file, interpreting lines according to operation codes and pseudo-operations, and updates the context accordingly.

- **Symbol and Literal Table Management**: Dynamically generates and updates symbol and literal tables, assigning memory locations to labels and literals found within the assembly input.

- **Output Generation**: Compiles the processed assembly instructions along with the final symbol and literal tables into a structured output, saved to a specified file.

## üìö Documentation

The project is well-documented with comments explaining the key sections of the code. The `processLine` function, responsible for processing each line of the assembly code, is particularly important. It takes a line of assembly code and a context object as arguments, and returns the processed line.

The `pass1Assembler` function is the main function that reads the input file, processes each line, and writes the processed lines to the output file. It takes two arguments: `inputFilePath` and `outputFilePath`, which are the paths to the input and output files, respectively.
